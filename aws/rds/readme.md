<summary>if writer instance terminates </summary>
  If the writer instance in Amazon RDS is terminated, the behavior will depend on whether you have configured Multi-AZ deployment or not.

If you have configured Multi-AZ deployment, then Amazon RDS will automatically promote the standby instance to be the new writer instance. This process is automatic and typically takes only a few minutes to complete. Once the promotion is complete, the new writer instance will be available for read and write traffic, and any existing read replica instances will automatically switch to replicate from the new writer instance.

If you have not configured Multi-AZ deployment, then you will need to manually launch a new writer instance and restore a backup of the database to the new instance. This process can take some time, depending on the size of the database and the amount of data that needs to be restored. Once the new writer instance is available, you will need to update your application to point to the new instance.

It's important to note that in either case, any read replica instances associated with the original writer instance will continue to function normally, as they are not affected by the termination of the writer instance.

<summary>can i promote read-replica to become new writer? </summary>
  Yes, you can promote a read replica to become a new writer instance in Amazon RDS. This can be useful in situations where the original writer instance has failed or needs to be taken offline for maintenance.

To promote a read replica to become a new writer instance, you can use the "Promote Read Replica" feature in the Amazon RDS console or the AWS CLI. When you promote a read replica, it will become the new writer instance, and any existing read replica instances will automatically switch to replicate from the new writer instance.

It's important to note that promoting a read replica to become a new writer instance will cause the original writer instance to become a read replica of the new writer instance. This means that any changes made to the original writer instance after the promotion will be lost, as they will not be replicated to the new writer instance.

Also, it's important to ensure that the read replica you are promoting has the latest data from the original writer instance before promoting it. You can do this by checking the replication lag between the read replica and the original writer instance, and ensuring that it is minimal.
