restrict pods to be places on nodes:
taint (node) and tollarations (pods)

kubectl describe node kubemaster | grep Taint     (noschedule - means not schedule pods on this node)

kubectl taint nodes node01 spray=mortein:NoSchedule             -- create taint on a node
the effect must be NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule or NoExecute.
  *  Currently taint can only apply to node.

tollarate pod to this tainted node:
controlplane ~ âžœ  cat bee.yaml 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: bee
  name: bee
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: bee
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
  tolerations:
  - key: spray
    value: mortein
    effect: NoSchedule
    operator: Equal


--------------
remove taint on node:
kubectl taint nodes controlplane node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule-
