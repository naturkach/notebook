<summary>What is the difference between declarative and imperative infrastructure as code?</summary>
<br> Declarative is more flexible. 
  Explanation: Declarative infrastructure as code (IaC) focuses on describing the desired end state of the infrastructure, 
  without specifying the exact steps needed to get there. 
  This allows for more flexibility in how the infrastructure is provisioned and managed, as the system can determine the most efficient way to achieve the desired state.
