<summary>what is GitOps</summary>
  
GitOps is a modern software development methodology that uses Git as a single source of truth for defining and managing 
infrastructure and application deployments. It is based on the idea of declarative infrastructure, where the desired state 
of the infrastructure is defined in code and stored in a Git repository.

In GitOps, all changes to the infrastructure and application deployments are made through Git commits, 
which trigger automated workflows that apply the changes to the target environment. This approach provides several benefits, 
including improved visibility, traceability, and auditability of changes, as well as increased collaboration and faster feedback loops.

GitOps is often used in conjunction with container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, where it can be used to manage the deployment 
and configuration of containerized applications. It is also used in cloud-native environments, where it can help to automate the management 
of cloud resources and services.
