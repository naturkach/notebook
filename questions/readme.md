<summary>what is GitOps</summary>
  
GitOps is a modern software development methodology that uses Git as a single source of truth for defining and managing 
infrastructure and application deployments. It is based on the idea of declarative infrastructure, where the desired state 
of the infrastructure is defined in code and stored in a Git repository.

In GitOps, all changes to the infrastructure and application deployments are made through Git commits, 
which trigger automated workflows that apply the changes to the target environment. This approach provides several benefits, 
including improved visibility, traceability, and auditability of changes, as well as increased collaboration and faster feedback loops.

GitOps is often used in conjunction with container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, where it can be used to manage the deployment 
and configuration of containerized applications. It is also used in cloud-native environments, where it can help to automate the management 
of cloud resources and services.

<summary>SDLC</summary>
<br> 
  SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) methodologies are a set of processes and practices used by software development teams to design, develop, test, and deploy software applications. There are several SDLC methodologies, including:

- Waterfall: This is a linear, sequential approach to software development, where each phase of the development process is completed before moving on to the next phase.

- Agile: This is an iterative, incremental approach to software development, where the development process is broken down into small, manageable chunks called sprints.

- Scrum: This is a specific type of Agile methodology that emphasizes teamwork, collaboration, and communication among team members.

- Kanban: This is another Agile methodology that focuses on visualizing the workflow and limiting work in progress to improve efficiency and productivity.

- Lean: This is a methodology that emphasizes reducing waste and maximizing value in the software development process.

- DevOps: This is a methodology that combines software development and IT operations to improve collaboration and streamline the software development process.

<summary>RPO/RTO</summary>

  it's desaster recovery 
  - RPO = dataloss - how much time from last we can los (backup 1 hour/1 day)
  - RTO = downtime for recovery  (time from service downtime to recovery)

  less RPO/RTO time = more cost for infrastructure
