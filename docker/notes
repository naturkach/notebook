cgroups & namespaces
The backbone of the Docker technology are cgroups (short for control groups) and kernel namespaces, both of which are features already provided in the Linux kernel

cgroup
With cgroups, the Linux operating system can easily manage and monitor resource allocation for a given process and set resource limits, like CPU, memory, and network limits. 
The kernel can now control the maximum amount of resources a process gets. 
This lets the Docker engine only give out 50% of the computer's memory, processors, or network, for example, to a running Docker container.

Namespaces
Namespaces are helpful in isolating process groups from each other. There are six default namespaces in Linux: mnt, IPC, net, usr, pid, and uts. 
Each container will have its own namespace and processes running inside that namespace, and will not have access to anything outside its namespace.

Union File System
Docker uses the union file system to create and layer Docker images. This means all images are built on top of a base image, actions are then added to that base image.
